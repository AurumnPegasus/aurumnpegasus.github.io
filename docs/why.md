# Why a Blog?

I am starting this blog for two key reasons. First, I love learning, and I've found that the best way to deepen my understanding is by teaching others. I'll be explaining concepts in a way that I would if I were teaching someone else. Second, I believe that sharing my progress publicly helps keep me accountable. The internet will be my accountability partner on this journey. This marks a fresh start for me—I’ve deleted my previous posts as they didn’t align with the direction I want to take now.

Let's see where this takes us.
