I am starting this blog for two key reasons. First, I love learning, and I've found that the best way to deepen my understanding is by teaching others. I'll be explaining concepts in a way that I would if I were teaching someone else. Second, I believe that sharing my progress publicly helps keep me accountable. The internet will be my accountability partner on this journey. This marks a fresh start for me\u2014I\u2019ve deleted my previous posts as they didn\u2019t align with the direction I want to take now. Let's see where this takes us. Things I want to do Research : Goal: Complete at least one more paper in a new domain with lower effort. Current Status: Working on a paper with Lakshya; hoping for success. Plan: Research current events in NLP daily during office hours to identify potential topics and complete the paper. Deep Learning : Goal: Deepen understanding by building models from scratch. Current Status: Following Andrej's video series in Python and replicating the work in C++ to learn both the subject and the language. Plan: Continue with this approach for now. Mathematics : Goal: Learn mathematics formally, akin to a math degree. Current Status: Unsure where to start; plan to consult Arjo. Plan: Determine a starting point and begin structured learning. Civics : Goal: Understand the laws and current events in the country. Current Status: Found a resource\u2014IAS lecture series on YouTube. Plan: Follow the lecture series to enhance civic knowledge. Operating Systems : Goal: Improve knowledge for job prospects. Current Status: Passed OS courses in college with a C grade; need to refresh and deepen understanding. Plan: Focus on job-relevant OS topics to strengthen knowledge. Competitive Programming (CP) : Goal: Avoid last-minute grind if ever without a job. Current Status: Wants to be prepared in advance. Plan: Dedicate 30 minutes daily to CP questions for gradual improvement. Fitness (Gym) : Goal: Become thinner, faster, and more agile. Plan: Regular gym sessions to achieve fitness goals.","title":"Why a Blog?"},{"location":"why/#why-a-blog","text":"I am starting this blog for two key reasons.
